## Bio 
**Hi my name is Rui Oliveiras,**
and I started in the world of programming back to 2010 in a professional high school in my little town. On that course I remember of using technologies like Pascal and Visual Basic (.net), and of course the old C.
During this programming professional course I participated in some algorithm contests, was very challenging.

**The entrance on the university was a little hard**, the math of my course was very rudimentary. But frequenting the lessons of regular high school I could learn the necessary math to have a good grate and enter in the university.

**In the university of Minho** I studied for 3 years Informatic Engineering, because already had background in programming, could deepen my knowledge. I learned a lot.

**My first Job** was very challenging, I worked at Adclick, in a project made only by me. I went to WebSummit 2016 bacause of that project.

**Right now I'm working in a team, the FOX team!** programming an enterprise software: the Order Management System of the Jumia.
