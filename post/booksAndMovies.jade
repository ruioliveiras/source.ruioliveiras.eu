   ## "Netchaiev ha vuelto" - Jorge Semprum
   Is Crime book, about the return of "Netchaiev": an Marxismâ€“Leninism extremist (and also terrorist).
   
   There are some interested things wich i'mg going to highlight:
   
    -  The question is not why we stop to be terrorist - it is just open the eyes and listening to voices of reality -
       The question are why we even started? Why we use terrorism?

   Second part, Cap 11, page 291,
  
   #### The Revolutionary Catechism (a reference of this book)

     - The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no personal interests, no business affairs, no emotions, no attachments, no property, and no name. Everything in him is wholly absorbed in the single thought and the single passion for revolution.
