I have found the old camera of my father. This camera was bought by my father
in the 80's in Saudi Arabia.

Searching the internet about this camera:

<a href="http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Yashica_FX-3" target="_blank">http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Yashica_FX-3</a>

> These inexpensive cameras have developed a reputation for **reliability**, mostly due to their extremely simple construction and durable metal chassis with plastic outer shell.    

**Reliability** - its a very good way to define this camera, because after 10 years
stored. It was just put frames and a battery (the battery is required for the photometer).
And the Camera was working, taking very good photos!!
